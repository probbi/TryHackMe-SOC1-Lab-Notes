üêß **Conclusion** </br>
Although I have been a Linux user since 2008, these rooms have been a valuable refresher. They have helped me re-learn basic commands and system concepts, while also introducing me to some tools and practices that I have not or rarely encountered before. From basic file system navigation to SSH access to permissions and system maintenance, the content has reinforced and updated my practical Linux knowledge. It has reinforced my core skills in a well-structured and practical way.
